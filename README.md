# IPL Qualification Calculator

Calculates the mathematical chances of each team qualifying for playoffs in Indian Premier League (Vivo IPL bhi bol sakte hai ðŸ™‚)

The compute intensive algorithm is implemented in Rust, and interfaced to Javascript through WebAssembly.

It also gives many interesting insights into how the chances change, and affect each other, some observations can be found in data/graph_data.json. And i am planning to use it to show the graph of how the chances varies match by match.

More instructions to README will be added after the graph feature is added
